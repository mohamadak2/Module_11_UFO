# Module_11_UFO

## Overview of Project
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The Idea of this analysis was to be able to obtain data. This case it was about UFOs sightings. Then the best way to get the word out to people was to display this information onto a website. We wanted to also have the ablility to filter through the date within the site.

We created filters where you can look a certain types of information.

## Results
### Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

You can use the Navigation bar to get to the article " UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy? ". Then you would be about to read about the UFO Sighting:

Then the individual may wanted look a sightings withing a certain country:

However, we are allowed to use multiple filtering options.
So we can look at sightings in the "us" an within the state "ca"

This would prove to be beneficial for individuals.

## Summary
### In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One downside to this design is that you cannot have multiple subfilters. For example, if you wanted to look at sightings for "ca" and "az", that would require two seperate searches.

Future improvements:
1) I would say to allow an individual to display a table with mutiple cities, states, country, shape and even a date range.

2) Allow the user to export the data into an csv or excel file so that they can run they external calcualtions and analysis.


Otherwise here is the site:

### May You Find The truth!
